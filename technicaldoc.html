				JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
			</p>
			<p>
				JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects

				JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
			</p>
			<p>
				In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.

			<p>
				You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
			</p>
			<p>
				A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
			</p>

				var x = 42.
			</code>
			<code>
				x = 42

			<p>
				When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.
			</p>
			<p>
				JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.
			</p>
			<code>
				if (true) { var x = 5; } 
				console.log(x); // 5
			</code>
		</section>

			<header>Function</header>
			<p>
				A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by: The name of the function, A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { }.
			</p>
			<p>
				The function square takes one argument, called number. The function consists of one statement that says to return the argument of the function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return statement specifies the value returned by the function.
			</p>
			<code>
				function square(number) { return number * number; }
			</code>
			<code>
				return number * number;
			</code>
